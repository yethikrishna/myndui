/**
 * Server-side star count, resolved at BUILD time and baked into the static HTML
 * (`cache: "force-cache"`) — so the number is in the initial paint with no
 * client pop-in or layout shift.
 *
 * This fetch runs in the root layout, so a time-based `revalidate` here would
 * set an ISR window on the WHOLE route tree (~218 pages), and every page would
 * re-write its ISR cache each window — the source of the huge ISR write bill.
 * `force-cache` gives the value no expiry: pages stay fully static and never
 * revalidate at runtime, so the docs contribute ~zero ISR writes (they only
 * rebuild on deploy, which is when the star count also refreshes). The badge is
 * kept live between deploys by a lightweight client refresh in <GitHubStars>,
 * which updates the already-rendered number in place (still no layout shift).
 *
 * React `cache` dedupes it within a single render pass. Returns null on any
 * failure; the badge then renders the icon alone.
